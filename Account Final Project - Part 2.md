`ROE` stands for Return on Equity
$$\text{ROE} = \text{NPM} \times \text{Asset Turnover} \times \text{Equity Multiplier} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholder Equity}}$$
`Asset Turnover` is the measure of asset use efficiency
`Equity Multiplier` is a measure of a company's financial leverage
`CAPM` is the Capital Assets Pricing Model
- $\beta$, or 'beta' of an investment determines if it will add risk to the portfolio. Starbucks has a $\beta$ less than 1, so it would reduce a portfolio's risk.

If ROE goes up, investors are getting a higher rate-of-return for their equity invested in the company. But importantly, if ROE goes up it might also mean that the company simply took on more debt, decreasing shareholder equity, and subsequently increasing the total value of ROE. If the latter is the case, they are more leveraged which might be a positive thing but also indicates a certain level of risk with the stock.

So, basically, we need to learn more in order to avoid making dangerous assumptions.

If a company's ROE goes up due to an increase in the net profit margin or asset turnover, this is a very positive sign for the company. However, if the equity multiplier is the source of the rise, and the company was already appropriately leveraged, this is simply making things riskier. If the company is getting over-leveraged, the stock might deserve more of a discount despite the rise in ROE. The company could be under-leveraged as well. In this case, it could be positive and show that the company is managing itself better.

Even if a company's ROE has remained unchanged, examination in this way can be very helpful. Suppose a company releases numbers and ROE is unchanged. Examination with DuPont analysis could show that both net profit margin and asset turnover decreased, two negative signs for the company, and the only reason ROE stayed the same was a large increase in leverage. No matter what the initial situation of the company, this would be a bad sign.

# Question 1: *Has the stock market liked your company over the past five years?*

If Starbucks exceeded 65%, do you think the investors were appropriately compensated for the risk?

- [ ] Why was Starbucks so performant?
- [ ] Maybe need to do some other (non-CAPM) analysis of the RRR to add to our descriptions. There are lots of other methods outlined on the internet.
- [ ] Not sure how much he wants us to write and about what exactly

- - - 
# Question 2: *If your company outperformed the S&P 500 Index or it did not, what does the ratio analysis tell us could have been factors that led to the over or underperformance relative to the S&P 500 Index?*

I am pretty certain based on Q1 that Starbucks outperformed the market by a substantial margin.

- [ ] Do ratio analysis (ROE, ROA) breakdown - the calculations are all on our excel sheet
- [ ] Determine the decomposed drivers of ROE and ROA
- [ ] He wants us to perform FSA? What exactly does this mean?
	- [ ] Evaluate the company's revenue growth compared to industry peers and the overall market.
	- [ ] Examine the gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin to understand the company's profitability
	- [ ] Evaluate the company's liquidity through metrics like the current ratio and quick ratio to assess its ability to meet short-term obligations.
	- [ ] Examine the company's debt levels and debt-to-equity ratio to understand its solvency and financial leverage.

# Question 3: *You now have, not only ROA and ROE components, but you have a common-sized Income Statement and a common-sized Balance Sheet that allow you to see and (perhaps) also perform trend analysis (if you don’t recall, find out what trend analysis is relative to common-sized financial statements).*

- [ ] Study the DuPont analysis (with and without tax expense) and the common-sized Income statement across the ten years
	- [ ] What does this analysis tell you that looking at the actual financial statements does not tell you?
- [ ] Discuss and interpret the overall trends in the two components of the ROA computation over the five-year period for your company using ROA with and without taxes and the common-sized income statement.
	- [ ] Discuss the trends and changes in PROFIT MARGIN and ASSET TURNOVER over the five years

# Question 4: *What would you suggest to management to make your company a more profitable company and I suggest including nonfinancial information such as sales (net revenues) per store, sales per employee, or however you best believe (from the 10K discussions) that your company focuses on financial and nonfinancial information?*

- [ ] For example, retail stores typically focus on Sales per square foot for their stores, number of customers, and/or price per bag (average of a customer purchase walking out of the store that day, week, or month). 
	- [ ] Find such information if you can and analyze it with the financial information.
- [ ] Pretend you are sitting in the Board Room with your company’s management and its directors
- [ ]

# Question 5: *Given the most recent price of your company’s stock, the company appears undervalued (i.e., intrinsic > price) - using what you learned from Part 1 and the added analysis, comment on whether you agree (or not), and why using actual data.*

Intrinsic value of Starbucks Corp. common stock (per share):	$134.22
Current share price:	$99.20
